# Input-output-linearization-control-approach-to-control-the-unicycle-s-position



The aim of this project is to implement an input/output linearization control approach to control the unicycleâ€™s position and bring it from $q_i$= [0 0 0$]^T$ to the point $q_f$= [4 1 $\pi \over 2$ $]^T$. The trajectory is adjusted to fit the desired coordinates of the reference point B along the sagittal axis.

In the pdf: "cubic Cartesian polynomial.pdf" the analysis made is explained in detail.
